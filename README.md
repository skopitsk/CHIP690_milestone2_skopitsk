# Milestone 2 Final Nalysis on AMD Prevelance
This file contains the analysis conducted to understand the crude prevalence of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) across different age groups and U.S. states using data from the CDC's Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).

## Data Source
The analysis uses data from Export (2).csv which contains state level crude prevelance estimates for AMD structured by age groups. 

# Research Questions

## Q1. How does the crude prevalence of age related muscular degeneration vary across different age groups?
FOr this analysis, I filtered the dataset for "Crude Prevalence" of "Prevalence of AMD" and calculated the mean prevalence for each age group across all states. A bar chart was generated to visualize the progression.

**Key Findings:**
The mean crude prevalence shows a strong, progressive increase with age.
The difference in mean crude prevalence between the oldest group (`85 years and older`) and the youngest group (`40-64 years`) is 37.74 percentage points** ($45.01\% - 7.27\%$).


### Q2. Which U.S. states show the largest and smallest increases in crude AMD prevalence when comparing adults aged 40-64 to those aged 85 and older?
The code isolated data for the `40-64 years` and `85 years and older` groups, pivoted the data to compare states, and calculated the absolute difference in prevalence for each state. The results were sorted into tables to identify the extremes.

**Key Findings (Largest Increase):**
The state with the steepest progression (largest increase) was Florida with an increase of 51.00 percentage points.

| LocationDesc | Prevalence (40-64) | Prevalence (85+) | Increase in Prevalence |
| Florida | 9.84 | 60.84 | 51.00 |


**Key Findings (Smallest Increase):**
The state with the shallowest progression (smallest increase) was the District Of Columbia with an increase of 19.85 percentage points.

| LocationDesc | Prevalence (40-64) | Prevalence (85+) | Increase in Prevalence |
| District Of Columbia | 3.65 | 23.50 | 19.85 |
